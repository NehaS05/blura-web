            It all started with a simple truth: water is the most essential
            thing we consume, and we are consuming it in the most harmful way.
            Mountains of plastic waste, microplastics invading our bodies, and a
            planet begging for a timeout. It was time to change the flow.
            <br />
            <br />
            And we listened. We chose Truth over Trends.
            <br />
            We ventured to the Himalayan foothills, where the air is thinner,
            the thoughts are clearer, and the water, wiser. blüra is a whisper
            from the mountains. Drawn from ancient Himalayas, it is a
            mineral-rich, naturally filtered water that flows through Himalayan
            rocks, containing elements such as calcium, magnesium, and
            bicarbonates, that not only hydrate but also revitalise. No
            chemicals. No gimmicks. Just the earth’s wisdom in a Can.
